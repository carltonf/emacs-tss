Some notes on =typescript-tools=.

* Bugs
** TODO Empty string command yields error.
** TODO Error report are too vague.
e.g. out of file boundary error says nothing.

* Format on the response

** =definitions=
=response.def.textSpan= doesn't seem to be meaningful, are they the char
position with all whitespace squeezed?

** =quickInfo=
when =documentation= array is not empty?
